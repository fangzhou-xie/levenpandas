## levenpandas

I recently needed to fuzzy-matching some relatively large datasets
and failed to find any package that would suit my need.
So I ended up writing my own.



## Installation

```
pip install levenpandas
```


## Dependencies

There are only two packages that are imported by this `levenpandas`:
`pandas` and `python-Levenshtein`.
They are listed as the requirements of this package, and you should
have them after installing `levenpandas`.

## Description

I wish to match two columns of `pandas.DataFrame` object fuzzy matching,
and wish to do so by evaluating the Levenshtein distance between
each pair of elements in the two columns.

There are a number of good packages, including `fuzzywuzzy`, `fuzzy-pandas`.
`fuzzy-pandas` turns out to be slow in my application,
while `fuzzywuzzy` reports the similarity ratio range between 0-100,
and round it to integers.

In my case, I need something that gives me a similar sytax as `pandas`,
could work with `pandas.DataFrame`, and possibly with parallel support.
And these three features are the main building blocks of this `levenpandas`.

There is only one function that has been exposed: `fuzzymerge()`.

Example:

```
from levenpandas.levenpandas import fuzzymerge
```
