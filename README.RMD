## levenpandas

I recently needed to fuzzy-matching some relatively large datasets
and failed to find any package that would suit my need.
So I ended up writing my own.



## Installation

```
pip install levenpandas
```


## Dependencies

There are only two packages that are imported by this `levenpandas`:
`pandas` and `python-Levenshtein`.
They are listed as the requirements of this package, and you should
have them after installing `levenpandas`.

## Description

I wish to match two columns of `pandas.DataFrame` object fuzzy matching,
and wish to do so by evaluating the Levenshtein distance between
each pair of elements in the two columns.

There are a number of good packages, including `fuzzywuzzy`, `fuzzy-pandas`,
but they turns out to be slow in my application.
